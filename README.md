# Self-Hosted Evaluation

**Deep, hands-on evaluations for self-hosted software. Beyond lists, we test, compare, and guide your self-hosting decisions.**

## 🎯 Why This Exists

The `awesome-selfhosted` list and others like it are invaluable for discovery, but they leave a critical gap: **“Which one should I *actually* choose?”**

This project aims to fill that gap. We go beyond listing software to provide **in-depth, side-by-side evaluations** that consider what matters most in a self-hosted environment: deployment complexity, resource consumption, security posture, and long-term maintainability.

## 🧪 Our Methodology: Not Just an Opinion

Every review is based on a transparent and repeatable framework, focusing on practicalities:

1.  **Deployment & Setup**: Initial effort, documentation quality, and configuration complexity.
2.  **Resource Footprint**: CPU, memory, and storage usage under typical loads.
3.  **Security & Maintenance**: Update frequency, vulnerability management, and backup story.
4.  **Core Functionality & UX**: Does it do its primary job well? Is the interface intuitive?
5.  **Ecosystem & Integration**: API quality, community support, and extensibility.

We run software in controlled environments, perform common tasks, and document the real-world results.
