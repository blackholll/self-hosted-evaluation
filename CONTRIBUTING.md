# Contributing to Self-Hosted Evaluation

🎉 **First off, thank you for considering contributing to this project!** 🎉

We are building a community-driven knowledge base for in-depth evaluation of self-hosted software. All contributions, from fixing a typo to writing a full review, are highly valued.

## 🗺️ How Can I Contribute?

### 1. Suggest a New Evaluation Topic
Is there a category of self-hosted software that lacks a deep-dive review? We want to hear about it!
- **How**: Open a new [Issue](https://github.com/blackholll/self-hosted-evaluation/issues).
- **Title Format**: Use `[Proposal] Category: Software Comparison` (e.g., `[Proposal] Media Servers: Jellyfin vs Emby`).
- **Content**: Briefly explain why this evaluation would be valuable, what key dimensions should be compared, and any initial insights.

### 2. Improve Existing Content
Found a typo, outdated information, or have more accurate data to add?
- **Minor Fixes (e.g., typos)**: You can use the "✏️ Edit this file" button directly on the GitHub page for a quick edit and submit a Pull Request (PR).
- **Substantive Changes or Additions**: Please open an **Issue first** to discuss the proposed changes before spending time on a PR. This ensures your effort aligns with the project's methodology and avoids duplication of work.

### 3. Contribute a Full Review
We encourage community-authored reviews! If you have deep, hands-on experience with a particular self-hosted software or a comparison, follow this process:
1.  **Check the Roadmap**: Look at open [Issues](https://github.com/blackholll/self-hosted-evaluation/issues) to see if the topic is already planned or being worked on.
2.  **Claim the Topic**: Comment on the relevant Issue or create a new one to express your intent to write the review. This helps coordinate efforts.
3.  **Follow a Structure**: We are working on a standard review template. For now, please follow the general structure of existing reviews (when available) and focus on providing **detailed, evidence-based comparisons**. Open an Issue to discuss your review outline before writing.
4.  **Submit a Pull Request**: Once your draft is ready, submit a PR. A maintainer will review it for content, structure, and adherence to our guidelines.

## 🔧 Development & Pull Request Process

1.  **Fork the Repository**.
2.  **Create a Branch** for your contribution (`git checkout -b feature/amazing-contribution`).
3.  **Make Your Changes**. Follow the established directory structure under `/reviews/`.
4.  **Commit Your Changes** (`git commit -m 'Add: detailed review of X'`).
5.  **Push to Your Branch** (`git push origin feature/amazing-contribution`).
6.  **Open a Pull Request** against the `main` branch.
7.  **Respond to Feedback**. A project maintainer will review your PR and may request clarifications or changes.

**Important**: By contributing, you agree that your work will be licensed under the project's [LICENSE](../LICENSE) (for content) and [LICENSE-CODE](../LICENSE-CODE) (for code).

## 📐 Code of Conduct & Guidelines

- **Be Respectful and Constructive**: We welcome diverse perspectives. Critique ideas, not people.
- **Focus on Evidence**: Back up claims with data, logs, or reproducible steps whenever possible.
- **Prioritize Practicality**: Our core audience is practitioners. Emphasize deployment experience, resource usage, and real-world usability.
- **Disclose Conflicts**: If you are contributing a review about a project you are affiliated with, please disclose this in your contribution.
